# Book Recommendation System

This Book Recommendation project will recommend four books according to the similarity of the book given.

I have used collaborative-based filtering technique.I have chosen user and book based on two criteria

  1. select those users who have given  more than 200 ratings in total

  2. select those books which has received more than 50 ratings.

After that I have generated ratings given by each user and find similarity between them. I have used cosine similarity to find distance between them.

Q: How the model works?
- I will give name of the book and model will predict similar books according to that.

## Technologies used
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn)
- Streamlit
- Flask

## Concept Understanding
- Unsupervised Learning
- collaborative filtering
- Cosine similarity
